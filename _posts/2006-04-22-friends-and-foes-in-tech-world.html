The Wall Street Journal ran a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114558083975931981.html?mod=djemTECH">story</a> about eBay. They said that eBay is now trying to collaborate and team up with Microsoft and Yahoo! to develop solutions to fight their common enemy Google. Well, it's going to get interesting to see what happens. I guess we are going to see more co-optetion amongst these players.
