Fareed Zakaria brings on highly influential guests on his wonderful show called GPS ("Global Public Square"). I truly enjoy his show. Watch this clip from CNN.com to see what I'm talking about. Malcolm Gladwell's insights are simple yet very powerful.<br /><br /><script src="http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/js/2.0/video/evp/module.js?loc=dom&vid=/video/us/2009/04/26/gps.fareed.intv.malcolm.gladwell.cnn" type="text/javascript"></script><noscript>Embedded video from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video">CNN Video</a></noscript>
