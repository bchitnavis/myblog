A friend of mine recommended I should read <a href="http://www.davidco.com/">David Allen</a>'s book "Getting Things DONE". So I went to the Barnes and Noble bookstore and picked up a copy. I already have a copy of <a href="http://www.stephencovey.com/">Stephen Covey</a>'s "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". I feel Covey communicates the underpinnings of personal productivity much more eloquently than David Allen.<br /><br />However, one of the striking similarities in both approaches is their emphasis on the <strong>weekly review</strong>.<br /><br />Fast Company published an interesting <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/34/allen.html">piece</a> of David Allen.
