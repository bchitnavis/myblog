This holiday season we enjoyed a "staycation." We stayed home and had a vacation. Watched a few holiday movies. I got the opportunity to explore the Net. Hulu.com offered a lot of entertainment. I watched several episodes of my favorite TV show, "The Office." Check it out on <a href="http://hulu.com">Hulu.com</a>.<br /><br /><object width="512" height="296"><param name="movie" value="http://www.hulu.com/embed/3EXnwYX4n4g7UIffw7HBSg"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><embed src="http://www.hulu.com/embed/3EXnwYX4n4g7UIffw7HBSg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true"  width="512" height="296"></embed></object>
