I woke up the day before yesterday morning, and got ready to go to work. As usual, I checked my Blackberry for new messages, and there it was, a message from Phil (my friend and colleague from North England), it said, "What is happening to London weather?" and there was an accompanying link showing images of what happened after the tornado hit London: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6217898.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/6217898.stm</a><br /><br />I have never heard of a tornado ever hitting London. It sounds freakish. So do some other natural disasters. I have been hearing and reading an awful lot about earthquakes, hurricanes, droughts, and tsumanis off late than I ever did before. So, while I was on the BBC web site I decided to look around. I found an interesting page which addresses climate change: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/</a><br /><br />It talks about the <strong>Evidence > Impacts > Adaptation > Policies </strong>of climate change and is quite revealing of what could happen if we didn't care for our environment. According to the <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>: <strong><em>'most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is likely to be attributable to human activities'</em></strong>.<strong> </strong>Now that is within our circle of influence and therefore fixable!
