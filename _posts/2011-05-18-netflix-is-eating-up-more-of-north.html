If Netflix is hogging up 30% now, it'll be interesting to see what happens when they expand overseas. The device ubiquity growth strategy for Netflix has contributed to their success thus far. When you put overseas expansion, especially, to the European, Latin American, and Asian countries (whenever that happens) we will have to wait and see how the company performs. Wall Street pundits have been struggling with the valuation of this new media company. I will not venture any predictions.<br />
