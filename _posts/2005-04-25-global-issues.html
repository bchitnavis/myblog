I thought long and hard about what I'd write about. There are so many things one could write about. But what do I feel strongly about? I don't just want to ramble on and bore the hell out of readers. So I decided to tackle global issues facing all of us first. For example, trade with China, or offshore outsourcing to India.<br /><br />Please suggest topics you folks would like to discuss on this forum. Thank you.
