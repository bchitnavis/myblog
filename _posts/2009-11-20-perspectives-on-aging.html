I have spent a good part of this year and last researching challenges and opportunities in healthcare. There are many challenges and even more opportunities. As I look at the debate unraveling the thorniest issues of our times I decided to step back a little bit. What have we learned in the past? Are we rehashing old issues?

Supporting the old requires a nation state to have a thriving young population. In Asia, we are at the cusp of seeing the same problem manifest in China.
