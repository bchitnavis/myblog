If you have not discovered Scribd yet, you must go to their website at http://www.scribd.com<br /><br />As an example, go to my <a href="http://businessintelligence.chitnavis.com/">BI Blog</a> to check out the iPaper of one of my Scribd documents. They have a pretty ambitious goal of converting all documents to electrons. In fact, if you look around on their website they have instructions for you to send paper form documents which they will convert to online documents for FREE. How cool is that?
