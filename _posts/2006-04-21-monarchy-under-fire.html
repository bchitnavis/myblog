What is currently happening in Nepal is no surprise. The last couple of decades have been marked by political instability. In 2001 King Birendra and his family members were killed. And now we are seeing protests against King Gyanendra. The people of Nepal are asking for restoration of Democracy. Hopefully this will happen soon.<br /><br />Coverage: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4929102.stm">BBC</a> and <a href="http://fullcoverage.yahoo.com/fc/World/Nepal">Yahoo!</a>
