<ul><li>Is China's growth purely attributable to the foreign direct investment? </li><li>Is this growth sustainable? </li><li>Are Chinese markets truly open? </li><li>Do they trade freely and fairly?</li><li>Will it be the next superpower? </li></ul><p>Like Myonggie said in an online post:</p><em>China was indeed a super-star topic at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos. It was a mixture of feelings and opinions, from moderate to extreme. Anxiety, fear, jealousy, hatred, disdain, resentment, worry, curiosity, respect, admiration, hope and greed, you name it, were all there. </em>
