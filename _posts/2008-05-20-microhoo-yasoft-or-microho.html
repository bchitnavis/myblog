The saga of Microsoft acquisition of Yahoo! continues. So MSFT wants to now acquire Yahoo! but not all of Yahoo! All right, what is Microho going to look like then? We know it is aimed at competing against Google in online advertising. However, Yahoo set up a partnership (they said it was experimental at first) with Google. Now MSFT is talking about steering more traffic to its own web sites. Activist investor Carl Icahn is pushing Yahoo to come to the table. Are these guys seeing value where none exists? History has proven great visionaries wrong. Remember AOL Time Warner? I am not very optimistic. Not very different from the Democratic Presidential nomination process. While Obama (YHOO) and Hillary (MSFT) fight, McCain (GOOG) is merrily solidifying his position.
