This seems like an interesting concept to me. The <a href="http://clipmarks.com">Clipmarks.com</a> web site got a good review from <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1947989,00.asp">PC Magazine</a>. I checked out their demo, I think I am going to try it out. Don't know if it's going to catch on.<br /><br />I believe this is another site which uses the Web 2.0 development technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX</a>. Stay tuned to read more on AJAX in my future posts.
