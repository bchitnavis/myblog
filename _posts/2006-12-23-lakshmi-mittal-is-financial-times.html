The Financial Times declared Lakshmi Mittal was their person of the year. Go to http://www.ft.com/indepth/person for an in depth look at the accomplishments of this steel magnate, the fifth richest person in the world according to Forbes.<br /><br />I found his down-to-earth personality which comes across during his interviews quite fascinating.
