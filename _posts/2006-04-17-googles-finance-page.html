The other day, my brother-in-law mentioned that Google has created it's own Finance page. I was very excited. I am a big fan of Google. They are one of the world's most innovative companies, having rightly earned a spot of the BusinessWeek's <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_17/b3981413.htm">The World's Most Innovative Companies</a>.<br /><br />When I visited the <a href="http://finance.google.com">Google Finance</a> page I noticed that it does not have a lot of meat. And it's BETA just like most of their other products. The interface is simple as well. I'll be watching what they do to this product. They have an extremely tough competitor in that space with Yahoo! Finance.
