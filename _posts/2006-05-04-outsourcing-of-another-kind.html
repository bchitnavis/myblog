A few months ago I was speaking to some of my friends at a lunch party. We were talking about <strong><em>outsourcing</em></strong> and this friend of mine said he was involved in the business of "Health Tourism". I was curious. Apparently, there are people who travel to places like India for heart bypass surgery (non-emergency procedures). Included in the price is a trip to the Taj Mahal. Overall, you'd end up spending much less than in the United States. Think about it....<br /><br /><u>Reproductive Tourism</u><br />A few days ago, I was struck by an article in the Star Tribune, the Minneapolis/St. Paul paper. They we talking about surrogate motherhood. Now there is a lady in India, must be many more who will carry a child for between $3,000 and $6,000.
