Arizona's economy could be impacted by the boycotts. There are several groups out there breaking their ties with Arizona. I searched "boycott arizona" and found online petitions, influential democrats, and lots of others wanting to teach AZ a lesson. However, this law seems very popular amongst non-Hispanic Arizonans. So, what is the Obama administration going to do. Is Arizona pushing the envelope? Is it cruel to do what is stated in the bill? I guess it depends on the implementation. Will this coerce the federal government into enacting a more compassionate legislation. Here's one analysis from Christopher Caldwell (writer at "The Weekly Standard"...<br /><blockquote><p>The passage of a law in the state of Arizona that would <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="FT - Arizona immigration law  stirs discrimination fears" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7cd0d040-4ef9-11df-b8f4-00144feab49a.html">stiffen  enforcement of US immigration laws</a> is a turning point. Like the <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="Immigration Act of 1924" href="http://tucnak.fsv.cuni.cz/%7Ecalda/Documents/1920s/ImmigAct1924.html">Immigration  Act of 1924</a>, which halted the flow of newcomers from Europe, it  will end decades of laxly regulated migration and begin a process of  cultural consolidation. There are 35m foreign-born people in the US,  roughly a third without papers. Opponents of the law promise to resist  it through boycotts and court challenges. It may indeed be overturned.  But such action is unlikely to be decisive. Challenges to its  constitutionality focus only on a handful of policing elements that  could easily be purged in replacement legislation. The bill is long,  detailed, carefully crafted and extremely popular. </p><p>The law treats  illegal entry into the US as a state crime. It authorises police  officers who have made “lawful contact” with a suspect – through an  arrest, for example – to determine whether he is legally in the US or  not. The measure is mild compared with policing laws routinely applied  to immigrants in other countries – the stop-and-search provisions of the  <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="Terrorism Act 2000" href="http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/pdf/ukpga_20000011_en.pdf">UK  Terrorism Act 2000</a>, for example, which were ruled unlawful by the  European Court of Human Rights earlier this year. It does, however, cut  against long-standing American expectations that a person be allowed to  circulate unmolested by the authorities. Doubtless, some US citizens  will be stopped and questioned. If poorly implemented, the bill could  lead to “racial profiling” – the use of physical appearance to decide  whether a person is “suspicious” – which is illegal in Arizona and many  other states.</p><p>The nub of the constitutional questions surrounding  the bill is that the federal government, not the states, sets  immigration policy. Does this bill usurp federal authority? At the most  basic level it does not – it leaves to Washington the determination of  who is and is not legally in the country. On the other hand, it makes  Arizona an inconvenient place to be an illegal immigrant. It does so by  establishing “attrition through enforcement” as its policy. </p><p>The  law makes it unlawful for illegal immigrants to solicit work, and for  citizens knowingly to hire them or transport them to jobs. Transporting  10 of them constitutes a felony. The law permits Arizona to transfer  illegal immigrants convicted of crimes to US immigration authorities  after they finish their jail sentences. It allows agencies to share with  one another the immigration status of residents. Under the law, an  illegal immigrant can be found guilty of trespassing if found on public  or private land.</p><p>The first lawsuits against the Arizona law were  filed on Thursday. The Colombian singer <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="Reuters - Shakira heads to Arizona to back  immigrant rights" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63Q5VE20100427">Shakira has  vowed to fight it</a>. Mexican authorities issued a travel alert to  their citizens. The Cardinal of Los Angeles compared Arizona legislators  to Nazis. Activists are pressuring major league baseball to move the  2012 All-Star Game out of Arizona. Washington DC, Los Angeles and San  Francisco have all called for boycotts of Arizona products. Supporters  of the bill counter that those cities – as so-called “sanctuary cities”,  which have a policy of not co-operating with federal authorities on  immigration violations – are in wilful defiance of the very statutes  they claim to be defending. </p><p>Even in Arizona, many politicians  have expressed fury. Phil Gordon, the mayor of Phoenix, described those  who favoured the bill as “bitter, small-minded and full of hate”. He has  threatened to sue the state, although it is doubtful he has the  authority. Democratic congressman Raúl Grijalva has backed an economic  boycott of his own state. His district has a Hispanic majority. Only 34  per cent of his constituents are non-Hispanic whites. (Which makes it  hard to see how singling out Hispanics for racial profiling would be  possible even in theory.)</p><p>Attitudes about immigration are  changing. For decades, businessmen, immigrants and consumers who wanted  fresh fruit and tidy offices formed a coalition that favoured irregular  immigration <i>de facto</i>, even while it remained illegal <i>de jure</i>.  The financial crisis (which has hit Arizona hard) and the increasing  violence of Mexican drug cartels along the US border (which may have led  to the grisly murder in March of a rancher in Cochise County known for  aiding migrants) have broken that coalition and led people to demand  change. Politicians have until now failed to provide it. </p><p>Sixty-four  per cent of Arizonans back the bill. The elements that survive legal  challenge are likely to be imitated in neighbouring states, to prevent a  spillover of migrants. Arizona governor Jan Brewer, who was on 40 per  cent in job-approval polls two weeks ago, is now on 56 per cent. The  number of those who “strongly approve” of her conduct has risen from 5  per cent to 22 per cent. Gallup has  found that a <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="Gallup - More Americans favor than oppose Arizona  Immigration Law" href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/127598/Americans-Favor-Oppose-Arizona-Immigration-Law.aspx">majority  of US voters who have heard of the law back it</a> – even in states far  from the border. </p><p>Immigration policy has taken a populist turn in  the US for the same reason it has done so elsewhere: because  politicians have tried to intimidate the public out of even reasonable  discussion of immigration. The political dynamics that made Arizonans  deem a new law necessary were not much different from those that led the  Swiss to vote for a ban on minarets last autumn. The episode in  Rochdale, England on Wednesday, in which UK prime minister Gordon Brown  referred privately to the widow <a class="bodystrong" target="_blank" title="FT - Brown caught off guard in ‘bigot’ row" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/28e84aa6-530b-11df-813e-00144feab49a.html">Gillian  Duffy as a “bigoted woman”</a> for raising questions about immigration,  was front-page news across the US. That is because Mr Brown mirrored  American politicians’ views of when it is proper for the public to talk  about immigration and what it is permissible to say. The answers,  apparently, are “never” and “nothing”.</p></blockquote><br /><div></div>
