My colleague at work, I will just use her first name - Ruth, has unique perspectives on life. She has been sharing her perspectives with me. With her 20+ years background in Peace Corps and rehabilitating refugees from various parts of the world she has developed a world view which is very unique. I do not always agree with her. Sometimes, I find her statements very provocative. But she substantiates her statements with examples. I will be sharing her thoughts with you from time to time. I hope it encourages you to think and if you would like to debate with her, please post your comments on this blog. I'm sure she will be thrilled to make you see her viewpoint!<br /><br />Here is a sampler of web sites she has shared with me so far:<br /><br /><a href="http://prisonplanet.ca/">Prison Planet</a><br /><a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=_dmPchuXIXQ&NR=1">Zeitgeist Video</a><br /><br />More to come...
