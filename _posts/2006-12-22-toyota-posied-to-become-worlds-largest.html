Toyota plans to make 9.42 million cars in 2007 that will make it the world's largest carmaker. General Motors, the current leader plans to make 9.11 million cars in 2007. <br /><br />Considering the circumstances under which the Japanese automakers started selling cars in the U.S. a few decades ago: the story goes like this... back in the days, the U.S. market was dominated by American cars, GM, Ford, Chrysler were the Big 3. The Japanese carmakers felt they needed to expand, they didn't have a presence in the U.S. Finally, an exclusively U.S. automobile dealer let a Japanese manufacturer display couple cars in a low traffic area on their lot... the rest is history!<br /><br />Is the same game being played out with the South Koreans?
