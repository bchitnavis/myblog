I am fascinated by everything about automobiles. My brief stint at an<br />automobile manufacturing company in India gave me good exposure to<br />various aspects of the business. So when I saw an article entitled<br />"born to be fuel-efficient" in the Personal Journal section of the<br />Wall Street Journal (May 21) it caught my fancy. I began to read with<br />great interest the rise of scooter use in the United States.<p>You know, when I came to the U.S. from India in the early 90s I used<br />to wonder why people didn't care for fuel efficiency. Well, gasoline<br />prices were below a $1 a gallon. Nobody cared about the cost of<br />jumping in the car and driving 50 miles. At the same time, in India<br />for all scooter and motorcycle manufacturers "fuel efficiency" was<br />front and center in their advertising campaigns. One motorcycle<br />campaign I remember was launched by Hero Honda, it said their bike was<br />so fuel efficient that customers could fill it (fuel tank), shut it,<br />and forget it. I believe Indians were paying close to $4 per gallon<br />back then. The rise of gasoline prices presents a similar dynamic in<br />the U.S. marketplace. American customers are paying attention to fuel<br />economy. Scooter use is expected to go up. Scooters cost less, they<br />are cheaper to insure, and way more fuel efficient than sedans (almost<br />two and half times better). In major cities parking costs may be<br />avoided as well. Go to <a href="http://nyscooterclub.com">NY Scooter Club</a> for information.<br />Although, I have to say I would be concerned about safety driving on<br />American roads. The trend in reversing in India. More people will<br />start buying cheap cars a la Tata Nano instead of scooters or<br />motorcycles. . They don't have great roads for cars, but that is<br />changing. In my opinion, safety is an issue.</p><p>There is an opportunity for America and India have a lot to learn from<br />each other.</p>
